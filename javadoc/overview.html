<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<p>
    The Step Functions library is a powerful and flexible tool for creating multiple-step functions.
    It provides users with the ability to create both synchronous and asynchronous step functions with ease.
    The library offers flexibility in defining custom steps and transitions, allowing for the creation of complex
    workflows with capabilities such as parallel branching, conditional branching, and branch merging with aggregation.
