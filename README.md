# Step Functions Library

This library allows you to create multiple-step functions with two types: `SyncStepFunction<T, R>` and `AsyncStepFunction<T, R>`.
Both types require an initial `Step<T, ?>` and an optional `Map<Step<?,?>, Set<Transition<?>>>` representing the initial defined transitions.
The `AsyncStepFunction<T, R>` also needs an `Executor`.

## How to Use

### Installation

To install the **Step Functions** library, add the following dependency to your project's build file:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation("com.koralix:step-functions:1.0.0")
}
```

Make sure to also add the GitHub packages repository to your build file:

```kotlin
repositories {
  maven {
    url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/koralix-studios/step-functions")
    credentials {
      username = project.findProperty("gpr.user") as String?
      password = project.findProperty("gpr.key") as String?
    }
  }
}
```

Don't forget to add the following properties to your `gradle.properties` file:

```properties
gpr.user=your_github_username
gpr.key=your_github_token
```

### Creating a StepFunction

To create a `StepFunction`, you can use either the `SyncStepFunction` or `AsyncStepFunction` class.
Here’s an example of how to create a `SyncStepFunction`:

```java
Step<String, Integer> initialStep = new Step<String, Integer>() {
    @Override
    public boolean isComplete() {
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public Integer apply(String input) {
        return input.length();
    }
};

SyncStepFunction<String, Boolean> stepFunction = new SyncStepFunction<>(initialStep);
```

And here’s an example of how to create an `AsyncStepFunction`:

```java
Executor executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);

AsyncStepFunction<String, Boolean> stepFunction = new AsyncStepFunction<>(initialStep, executor);
```

### Defining Steps and Branches

You can define additional steps and branches using the `addTransition` method.
Here’s an example of how to add a transition from one step to another:

```java
Step<Integer, Boolean> nextStep = new Step<Integer, Boolean>() {
    @Override
    public boolean isComplete() {
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public Boolean apply(Integer input) {
        return input % 2 == 0;
    }
};

stepFunction.addTransition(initialStep, nextStep, input -> input > 5);
```

In this example, we added a transition from the `initialStep` to the `nextStep`.
The transition will only be applied if the output of the `initialStep` is greater than 5.

### Executing a StepFunction

To execute a `StepFunction`, you can use the `apply` method.
Here’s an example of how to execute a `SyncStepFunction`:

```java
boolean result = stepFunction.apply("Hello World!");
```

And here’s an example of how to execute an `AsyncStepFunction`:

```java
CompletableFuture<Boolean> futureResult = stepFunction.apply("Hello World!");
futureResult.thenAccept(result -> {
  // some stuff
});
// or
boolean result = futureResult.join();
```

### Merging Branches

When one step transitions to multiple steps with the same output, all the states are executed.
Multiple execution branches can be merged into one using aggregation.
When the library tries to execute a step, it first checks if it is completed. If it is not, the execution is not submitted.
When a `Step` is applied multiple times from multiple branches, the result is aggregated in an internal variable.
When the `isComplete` method returns true, this data can be used to compute an aggregated result in this step based on the multiple branches that called this step.

### Termination

The termination condition for a `StepFunction` is reached when any step executes and does not have any valid transition to another step.
In this case, the output of that step will be the final result of the entire `StepFunction`.
It is important to note that all steps that can output a final result must return the same type.

### Possible Problems

Using the `addTransition` method during execution on an `AsyncStepFunction` may produce errors because thread safety is not guaranteed.
Make sure to only add transitions before executing the `AsyncStepFunction`.
